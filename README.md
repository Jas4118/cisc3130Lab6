# cisc3130Lab6
  This is code for Lab 6 for CISC3130 Section TY9 for Professor Katherine Chuang. Since this lab was left up to interpretation I decided to just create a system.out format in which the user inputs numbers and then it just goes through an array and sets it in the array. The grades[0] representing the Lab, grades[1] is the practice problems, grades[2] is the midterm and grades[3] is the final exam. We would add all these up in the end and a method would tell you how many points are needed to get the next letter grade.
